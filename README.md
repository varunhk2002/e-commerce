# e-commerce

This is a Simple E-commerce app I wrote for a college hackathon. Due to time constraints of the hackathon, it is incomplete. Will add more features later.

The main application code is in a file called 'views.py' (marketplace/views.py), which has 8 functions. The models are in a file called 'models.py' (marketplace/models.py).

Some screenshots of the applications:
